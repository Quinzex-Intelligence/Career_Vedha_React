                                In today's world, education is not just about studying — it is about understanding, preparing, and building a meaningful future. Yet, for millions of learners across India, this journey remains fragmented.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Students study subjects, prepare for exams, search for careers, look for jobs, and explore opportunities — but often across different platforms, without a clear connection between them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This lack of integration leads to confusion, missed opportunities, and decisions made without complete awareness. Career Vedha was created to bring everything together.
